    <h1>Yoga Medita Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: April, 30th, 2024</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>At Yoga Medita, we value the privacy and security of our users. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, protect, and manage the information of users who interact with our Yoga Medita mobile application. We urge you to read this policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.</p>

    <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
    <p>The Yoga Medita app can be used without registration, so we do not collect personally identifiable information from our users. However, to enhance the user experience and offer personalized features, we collect non-personal data related to the usage of the app, such as usage frequency and most used features.</p>

    <h2>3. Use of Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information collected exclusively to:
    <ul>
        <li>Generate usage statistics that allow us to improve the app and better adapt it to the needs of our users.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Information Protection</h2>
    <p>Data collected by Yoga Medita is stored locally on the user's device and is not transmitted to external servers. The information is permanently deleted once the app is uninstalled from the device.</p>

    <h2>5. Sharing Personal Information</h2>
    <p>We do not share users' personal data with third parties. All information generated and collected by the app remains confidential and exclusively for internal use of the app.</p>

    <h2>6. User Rights</h2>
    <p>Users have the right to access and control the personal data collected by the app, which in this case is limited to non-personal usage data. Since the information is stored locally, users can manage or delete their data directly on their devices.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time. If we make significant changes, we will notify users through an update or notification within the app.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:estebanarocha1@gmail.com">estebanarocha1@gmail.com</a></p>

    <h2>Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>The Yoga Medita app operates under the jurisdiction of Mexico and adheres to its laws and regulations regarding the protection of personal data.</p>
